/**
 * ReadCondition objects are conditions specifically dedicated
 * to read operations and attached to one DataReader.
 * <br>
 * ReadCondition objects allow an application to specify the data samples
 * it is interested in (by specifying the desired sample states, view states,
 * and instance states). See the parameter definitions for DataReader's
 * read/take operations.) This allows the middleware to enable the condition
 * only when suitable information is available. They are to be used in
 * conjunction with a WaitSet as normal conditions. More than one
 * ReadCondition may be attached to the same DataReader.
